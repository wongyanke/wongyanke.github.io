After listening to our VCâ€™s speech at the Malay Dignity Congress, this is what I WhatsApp our Deputy VC, asking for the favour to pass my message to him.


#### Message 

Hi Prof. Aziz. I listened to our VC's speech yesterday, it's a total disgrace to UM, whereby the most prominent figure in our varsity, he chooses to promote hatred and racism.
 
UM should be an inclusive campus, promoting racial harmony and national unity, nurturing critical thinking intellectuals, provide a safe place for academic freedom, upholding universal values shared by all mankind, NOT becoming a segregated place. How should we put ourselves for those who are non-Malays? He even mentioned, 'kuasa politik yang sepatutnya milik kita', where 'kita' refer to Melayu. I thought every Malaysian has equal political rights, why only one particular race is allowed to have it, but not shared equally by every citizen?
 
What should be addressed are the problems faced by the rakyat, not just one particular race. Tycoons are the one dominate the economy or the markets, not Chinese, why a person like me from B40 should become the victim to be blamed when the NEP doesn't work.
 
UMANY would like to be cooperative with administration, we have initiated a lot of reformation for student autonomy and welfare, even on currently we are working out to propose 'Student Benefits' card plan, draft a proposal to provide better shuttle bus service with limited budget given, prepare a memorandum to lobby with MPs and related ministries to make sure UM no longer need to suffer from the budget cut, propose UMSU constitution and etc....
 
But VC himself chooses not to be, he rather put his efforts of becoming a political puppet, helping the politicians to organize racial congress as a rival to the coalition of UMNO-PAS.
 
Prof, I know you are an understanding person, that's why I write the message to you.
 
60 years of independence, we are still stuck in a racial dilemma. Politicians playing with their agenda to keep them in power, even Pakatan Harapan which labelled themselves as New Malaysia choose to follow the trending of politics.
 
If so, aren't universities playing a bigger role right now? University is a place where we seek for truth and reason, provide knowledge to enlighten people from their ignorance, promote social change or even social justice. Shouldn't we guide and empower the people to be more critical and independent, able to identify the truth or false, to be more rational than just being a political animal who is easily get manipulated by hatred statements from politicians?
 
You might say, let's just face the reality, the problem has been there for 60 years, we can't fight with those who are in power. But, aren't the university is the place for idealism. Yes, I agree, the change that we made might be small, we might not be able to witness the effects up until 10 years. But, does it become the valid reason for ignoring our duty? We receive the funds by the taxpayers, shouldn't we have the obligation to contribute it back to the society, and move the society forward?
 
I know it's easy to speak compared to act. But I believe everyone can start to make a small change, it will create a huge impact from the accumulation of every progressive step we make. We should stop relying on political parties to help, but we should help our self. I am sure the university play a significant role now if we want to escape the racial dilemma or change the old political environment.
 
Despite our races or religion, every Rakyat should be our priority. I am here to beg the university administration, beyond any political parties, engage with the real social problem, to stand with Rakyat.
 
#### End
 
If VC still has his conscience, he should apologise publicly for his racist remarks and resign. Be a responsible intellectual.
